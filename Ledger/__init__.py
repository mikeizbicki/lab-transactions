        This function adds a row to the "transactions" table with the specified input values.
        It also updates the "balances" table to apply the debits and credits to the appropriate accounts.

        Notice two differences between this function and the code in `create_account`:
        1. This function does not use the connection.begin() function to start a transaction.
            When commands are not inside of a transaction block like this,
            then SQLAlchemy uses implicit transactions by default.
            This means that whenever a connection.execute command is called,
            SQLAlchemy will also call the BEGIN command internally.
            In order for a database modifying command (e.g. INSERT or UPDATE) to actually commit the value,
            you must call the self.connection.commit() command explicitly.
            It is also possible to enable "autocommit" to automatically commit these changes for you.
            The documentation contains detailed explanations: <https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/tutorial/dbapi_transactions.html>.

        2. This code uses f-strings instead of bind parameters.
            This can result in SQL injection vulnerabilities.
